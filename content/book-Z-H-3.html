  <p>This book is dedicated, in respect and admiration, to the
  spirit that lives in the computer.</p>

  <p>''I think that it's extraordinarily important that we in
  computer science keep fun in computing. When it started out, it
  was an awful lot of fun. Of course, the paying customers got
  shafted every now and then, and after a while we began to take
  their complaints seriously. We began to feel as if we really were
  responsible for the successful, error-free perfect use of these
  machines. I don't think we are. I think we're responsible for
  stretching them, setting them off in new directions, and keeping
  fun in the house. I hope the field of computer science never
  loses its sense of fun. Above all, I hope we don't become
  missionaries. Don't feel as if you're Bible salesmen. The world
  has too many of those already. What you know about computing
  other people will learn. Don't feel as if the key to successful
  computing is only in your hands. What's in your hands, I think
  and hope, is intelligence: the ability to see the machine as more
  than when you were first led up to it, that you can make it
  more.''</p>
